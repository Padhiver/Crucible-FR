The system’s dice mechanics allow for crunchy and tactically rich encounters featuring combat, exploration, or social challenges.</p><p>Crucible is both a role-playing game and a software engine. The game system offers a deep level of mechanical sophistication, but its rules are entirely encoded to be applied with consistency and automation. The system is built intentionally to eliminate the cumbersome bookkeeping that is prevalent in high-crunch pen-and-paper systems.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Development Status</h2><p>Crucible is now available for its <strong>Alpha Playtest</strong> which provides the community with a first look at the system, design pillars, and intended direction. The system is moderately functional, but still early in development. All areas of the system are works-in-progress and some areas are not yet developed at all. This playtest offers a chance for us to collect early feedback and share our work with the community. Please approach it with an open mind and an understanding that what you are seeing is still a long way from a finished product.</p><section class=\"construction\"><p>Blocks like this one in the system documentation highlight areas of the system that still require substantial development. These are intended to make you aware of areas that are intentionally unfinished at this time.</p></section><p>Development of Crucible is two-pronged with an equal focus on developing the system mechanics of the roleplaying game and the software implementation of those mechanics simultaneously. As the game mechanics evolve, new developments of the game system will enable those features for use in testing. The playtest process allows us to solicit and benefit from feedback that helps us iterate on the game rules and the user experience in Foundry Virtual Tabletop. We anticipate hosting multiple rounds of feedback, each focusing on a different aspect of the game experience.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Playtest One</h2><p>The first playtest, @UUID[Compendium.crucible.playtest.Adventure.F8AILycmdj2kuOVa]{Playtest 1 - The Ring of Valor}, is focused on @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.gszlBVQ5fGh3y0I6]{Character Creation} and @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.QhZgmBrdLAGwYy5c]{Combat Encounters}. This playtest provides an abbreviated introduction to the Crucible game system, covering character creation, dice mechanics, combat encounters, and level advancement. The playtest begins at level 1 and advances characters through level 6 allowing them to evolve and advance their character between each challenge of the test.</p><section class=\"construction\"><p>Please note that the rules and mechanics featured in this playtest are not final. Most talents, skills, and rules will be further refined during later phases of development.</p></section><h2 class=\"divider\">Ember</h2><p>There is far more Crucible content available as part of our original setting and epic adventure <a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/ember\">Ember</a>, which is now in Kickstarter Beta testing phase. Ember is available for pre-order, and will contain an immense campaign for Crucible spanning several years of gameplay taking your party from character level 1 to 12 (or beyond).</p>"

          "text": "<p>Crucible is built with the following cornerstones and design principles in mind.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Consequential Character Progression</h2><p>A primary goal for Crucible is to provide systems for meaningful, exciting, and impactful character progression. Creating and advancing a character in Crucible should be enjoyable and impactful as you gain access to new capabilities that tangibly evolve your playstyle and character persona.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Strategic Grid-Based Combat</h2><p>Game mechanics in Crucible are designed for application to encounter or area maps with a structured grid which defines distances and positions of characters to create tactical choices about movement during combat. Movement actions and costs, engagement, flanking, cover, area-of-effect abilities, and more are all ways to add tactical nuance and dynamism to combat.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Consistently Automated Mechanics</h2><p>A key goal for Crucible is to design and implement mechanics which are seamlessly automated or theoretically capable of seamless automation. We don't want automation that distracts from gameplay with the need for bookkeeping - but we also want the underlying game mechanics which are automated to be understandable to players at the table. We don't want mechanics which are inscrutable simply because we have a layer of automation in front of them. In Crucible you will find game mechanics which are elegantly and intuitively designed, but our approach to full automation of those mechanics means you can stay focused on the fun of roleplaying.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Bring Your Own Story</h2><p>Crucible is optimized and designed with extended-form narrative in mind. While it can be used for one-shot adventures, the system's mechanics are intended to play out over months or years of game sessions.</p><p>Crucible provides relatively little rule-based guidance around narrative, personal character story, or the development of intrapersonal relationships - deliberately leaving these narrative pillars for the Game Master and players to explore using whatever setting or storytelling style they most prefer.</p><p>Crucible intentionally does not define a canonical setting. The system provides Gamemasters with tools to apply the system to a variety of settings. As a general rule of thumb, Crucible will work best in a gritty fantasy setting but it can be adapted for other genres and tones.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Ease of Powerful Use</h2><p>Crucible is designed to be a system which is easy to learn and easy to use. Gamemasters should feel empowered to tell the stories they want to tell, and players to play the characters they want to play. We want game mechanics in Crucible to be crunchy and strategic while being presented to players in a way that is intuitive and fun to engage with.</p>"

          "name": "Awareness",
          "text": "<h2>Overview</h2><p></p><p>Awareness is a measure of your skill in translating sensory input into useful information. A character with high Awareness is able to notice and interpret details that others might miss, and is able to quickly identify and react to threats.</p><p>While anyone might overhear conversations happening in a crowded room, those who have trained their Awareness can narrow their focus to more cleanly distinguish between one conversation and another. Similarly, a character who has trained their awareness might notice that the angle of an open door suggests an ambush awaits inside, someone who has not might only notice the open door.</p><p></p><h2>untrained</h2><p>You are able to spot obvious things about your environment, but important fine details may escape your notice.</p><h2>novice</h2><p>You have been trained in the basics of situational awareness, and are able to notice important details about your environment. You know to check for exits when you enter a room, and how to look for concealed weapons, hidden traps, and other threats. You know how to spot when you are being followed, and how to search for common hiding places.</p><h2>apprentice</h2><p>Small details only rarely escape your notice. You can discern between different conversations within a room, sift important details from the unimportant, and spy telltale signs of an ambush well in advance. You know how to identify less common hiding places, and identify the approach of others by the sound of their footsteps. You have learned to use reflective surfaces to watch behind you as you move, and how to rely on your peripheral vision to identify changes in your immediate surroundings.</p><h2>specialist</h2><p>Choose a specialization path for your Awareness training. You may choose either: Detective, Sentinel, or Prescient.</p><h2>adept</h2><p>You have honed your awareness to a fine edge. You are able to notice even the smallest details of your environment, and are able to quickly identify and react to dangers in your surroundings. Spotting hiding places is trivial for you, you are almost never taken by surprise, and even in a crowded room you are able to filter your senses to determine very specific details. Even slight changes in temperature or air flow rarely escape your notice.</p><h2>master</h2><p>You have perfected your Awareness by mastering your chosen specialization.</p><h2>Detective</h2><p>Detectives work toward perfecting their ability to identify very fine details left behind by the careless. Characters with a detective specialization are uniquely capable of using information gathered within a location to piece together how past events may have transpired. They are able to identify the identity of others who were previously within a location by identifying evidence of their passage, construct a timeline of events, and identify any objects which might be conspicuously absent. Master level detectives are nearly incapable of ignoring clues within their surroundings. They can't help but to notice the fine details that others ignore. Wrinkles on the shirt of an NPC might indicate that they were recently in a fight, a smudge of dirt might indicate that someone had traveled a particular path, a small scuff on a particular object might indicate the identity of who recently handled it.</p><h2>Sentinel</h2><p>Sentinels are trained to be aware of their surroundings at all times, and are able to notice even the slightest changes in their environment. They are very quick to note changes in their immediate environment, often first to notice ambushes, concealed weapons, hidden traps, and other threats. They are used to long hours standing watch, and are able to maintain a high level of alertness for extended periods of time. Master Sentinels have trained themselves to maintain a state of hypervigilance by following a rotating pattern of focusing their attention on distant and close surroundings. They make for tireless and attentive guards, and rarely fall prey to ambushes or traps. A Master Sentinel can spot the shift of body weight that precedes an attack, the subtle signs of tampering that indicate the presence of a trap, and are known for having a near extra-sensory perceptive ability to detect the presence of others.</p><h2>Prescient</h2><p>Prescients focus their awareness training on the delicate art of identifying the patterns in the behavior of others. Given a little time to observe a subject, a prescient can predict where they may be at any particular time of day, how the subject will react to a given situation, and what their likely course of action will be. A Master Prescient is uniquely capable of predicting the actions of others and the way events will unfold. With almost supernatural precision, they may identify the factors which contribute to an upcoming event, predict the movements of specific targets or groups, and identify the places and times to best introduce a change in order to affect the outcome of events.</p>"

You know how to use light and shadow to mask your presence, to distribute your weight when walking in order to move more quietly, and you have learned a few tricks of disguise in order to blend into a crowd. You can appear unsuspicious when surrounded by others, hide in a darkened room, and can move silently enough to avoid detection by the average person.</p><h2>apprentice</h2><p>You have honed the craft of sneaking to a fine art. People often comment that they didn't notice your arrival, and you often startle the inattentive. You can move silently enough to avoid detection even from those actively looking for intruders, and the subtlety of your movement rarely attracts attention. You can disguise yourself to appear as someone else, and may even have picked up a few tricks to bypass common locks.</p><h2>specialist</h2><p>Choose a specialization path for your Stealth training. You may choose either: Infiltrator, Chameleon, or Rogue.</p><h2>adept</h2><p>You are a ghost, a living shadow, most people can't agree on what you look like moments after you leave a room. You are capable of moving through nearly any environment without others noticing, and you often find yourself standing nearly atop others before gaining their attention. Even when others are actively searching for you, they often pass you by. You can assume a passable disguise for many roles, provided they do not need to pass close scrutiny.</p><h2>master</h2><p>You have perfected your Stealth by mastering your chosen specialization.</p><h2>Chameleon</h2><p>Few are as capable of blending in as the Chameleon. Chameleons focus their education on the art of blending in with their surroundings, using crowds and disguise to camouflage their presence. A Master Chameleon is capable of blending into nearly any crowd, and can assume a convincing disguise for nearly any role. In any given environment, they seem to others to simply belong. They exude a confident nonchalance which extends to their friends and allies.</p><h2>Infiltrator</h2><p>Few are as capable of blending in as the Chameleon. Chameleons focus their education on the art of blending in with their surroundings, using crowds and disguise to camouflage their presence.

They exude a confident nonchalance which extends to their friends and allies.</p><h2>Rogue</h2><p>Rogues tend to learn some of the more security-minded aspects of stealth: how to bypass locks and traps, to abuse distraction and inattention in order to slip things from (or into) the pockets of others. Rogues gain +2 boons to stealth rolls related to bypassing locks, disabling traps, and may use stealth to pickpocket others. For a Master Rogue the very concept of security is childish, there are few locks that don't yield and few pockets that can't be picked. A Master Rogue has trained to bypass the security of even the most heavily guarded locations.</p>"

Students of Arcana learn fundamental principles of metaphysics, study spiritual beings and deities, runic theory and ritual, the nature of chaos and order, and the history of how magical and spiritual forces impact societies and cultures. Arcana is the skill used to understand arcane and divine spells, the nature of spiritual beings, and any academic knowledge that may be related to either magic or religion.</p><p>The average person, even an adherent to a religious faith, may be aware of the existence of magic in the abstract sense, may have even seen it used, but they have no real understanding of how it works or what it is capable of when wielded by practiced hands.</p><p></p><h2>untrained</h2><p>You have no understanding of magic or metaphysical knowledge beyond what you've heard in song and story.</p><h2>novice</h2><p>Your education covered the fundamentals of metaphysics and magical theory, the relationship between the runes, the opposing nature of order and chaos, and a cursory introduction to spiritual beings including the most commonly known deified and demonized figures of worship. Your rudimentary understanding of the principle grammar of magic is sufficient to identify which lesser rune a spell or ritual may be using, as well as the gesture used (if not the inflection). You can identify whether a figure is influenced more by chaos or by order, and can spot the signs of common spirits (both lesser and greater). You know enough about religious customs to communicate with those who worship a particular spirit or deity without embarrassing yourself.</p><h2>apprentice</h2><p>The principles and theories of arcano-spiritual metaphysics are an open book to you, but you still have a lot left to learn. There are few deities and spirits of which you have not heard, and you have a studious grasp on the common magical theories as well as the principles associated with each of the lesser and greater runes. You know some of the basic rituals to invoke and communicate with spirits, and with sufficient time you could likely prepare a ritual to ward against them. With sufficient time to study a magical object or ritual, you might be able to discern its purpose and the runes from which it draws. You know the grammar of magic sufficiently to identify the rune, gesture, and inflection of a spell or ritual, or whether a spiritual entity comes from chaotic or orderly origins.You know how to navigate the turbulent waters of religious or magical academic discussion, and can identify the religious beliefs of others with just a few questions.</p><h2>specialist</h2><p>Choose a specialization path for your Arcana training. You may choose either: Elementalist, Primalist, or Theurgist.</p><h2>adept</h2><p>Your knowledge of magical theory is a vast ocean, the breadth of your religious education expansive. It might take you a little time to study, but you understand the origin and meanings of the most rare and obscure rituals, scriptures, and magical theories. You can reference lesser-known magical theorists by name, summarize their theories and the counter-arguments related to them, and you are able to identify the presence of magic almost as if it is a sixth sense. Where others might have trouble identifying particular spirits or deities, you can identify them by name quite easily, and know many of the common weaknesses and resistances associated with them. The workings of most magical spells, rituals, and items are an open book to you.</p><h2>master</h2><p>You have perfect command of Arcana by mastering your chosen specialization.</p><h2>Elementalist</h2><p>An Elementalist pursues and practices traditional arcane knowledge which focuses on understanding and mastery of the runic essences from which magic is derived. Elementalists have the greatest understanding of magical theory and the metaphysical laws of spellcraft.</p><h2>Primalist</h2><p>A Primalist focuses on understanding how magic interacts with the land and living creatures. Primalists have a less precise understanding of traditional theory, but a deepened attunement to fundamental sources of magical energy which can cultivate, empower, or destroy. Primalists are more likely to recognize loci of magical energy or to understand the motivations behind a particular work of spellcraft.</p><h2>Theurgist</h2><p>Theurgists focus on the deeply spiritual nature of magic and its relationship to the divine and to the soul. Theurgists focus heavily on understanding matters of life and afterlife. Theurgists also tend to be experts in knowledge of divine beings, religious rites, and symbolic ceremonies.</p>"

Those educated in the workings of Society study the factors which contribute to social structures. Knowledge of Society is used to establish historical or socio-political context, to identify the social rank of particular individuals, or to otherwise draw connections between a person or place and its most likely contributors. Those who study Society are often more capable of using that knowledge to gain the upper hand in social situations, though they are not necessarily more charismatic or socially adept – merely better informed.</p><h2>untrained</h2><p>You are blissfully unaware of historical events and social context.</p><h2>novice</h2><p>You have learned the fundamental building blocks of Society, the mores, beliefs, history and politics which directly inform the growth of culture.

You know the lineages of most prominent families for several generations and know the names of the most influential figures of the aristocracy. You know the names and stories of common folk heroes, and the origins and importance of common traditions.

They are trained to identify the most likely causes of historical events, and to draw connections between the past and the present. A historian is able to trace and identify the origins of ruins, verify authenticity of documents, relics, and use the breadth of their knowledge to aid others in their recall.</p><h2>Politician</h2><p>Politicians dedicate their area of study to understanding the workings of the political machine, and the motivations of those who operate it. They are trained to identify the most likely causes of political events, and where best to apply pressure in order to manipulate social situations. A politician is able to identify the most likely motivations of a political figure, and uses that knowledge to apply leverage and influence for their own ends.</p><h2>Scoundrel</h2><p>Scoundrels gain their societal knowledge through personal experience, often without the benefit of formal education. Their knack for understanding the motivations of others is often a matter of survival, and their fit within society often drifts toward the underclass. They move amid the seedy underbelly of society, building networks of contacts and informants, and mapping the social hubs where the aristocracy fear to tread.</p>"

Those who pursue an education in Deception are often politicians, diplomats, spies, thieves, or other professions for whom flexibility in the truth is a necessity. Practicing the art of deception reveals the one universal truth: everybody lies.

Not only can you tell lies in a way that makes them seem truthful, but you are equally capable of telling the truth in ways that make it seem like a lie. In most social settings you are a conductor, guiding others to hear what they want to hear and believe what they want to believe.

Their ruses and plans rely upon the manipulation of others, building scenarios and personas that others simply want to believe.</p><h2>Counterfeiter</h2><p>Conterfeiters specialize in the art of forgery, creating documents and items that are nearly indistinguishable from the true object. Counterfeiters support their deception with physical evidence, using of props and forged documents to contribute to their lies and the lies of others. Their skill with forgery is such that they can create convincing facsimiles of even the most complex documents and items.</p><h2>Mentalist</h2><p>Mentalists study the inner workings of mind and its social processes, gifted readers of body language and predictors of behavior.

Extortionists are not above using blackmail or leverage to get what they want, frequently applying their threats not to their target- but at that which their target holds most dear.</p><h2>Operator</h2><p>Operators are masters of subtlety, provoking fear and aggression in others and implying rather than outright stating their threats.

If a die is already a d12 due to other boons, the increase is applied to the next die in the pool. In practical terms, boons upgrade dice making them bigger and more effective.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Banes</h2><p>Each <strong>Bane</strong> applied to the check decrements the denomination of the last die in the pool by -2, to a minimum of <strong>d4</strong>. If a die is already a d4 due to other banes, the decrease is applied to the next die in the pool. In practical terms, banes downgrade dice making them smaller and less effective.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Mitigating Circumstances</h2><p>Because boons and banes start at opposite ends of the dice pool, they can both affect changes to the same roll. For example, a check made with with 2 Boons and 2 Banes would result in a dice pool of <strong>1d12 + 1d8 + 1d4</strong>. If more than four Boons and more than four Banes are present their effects will begin to cancel each other out.</p><section class=\"gameplay\"><h4>Example: Added Boons</h4><p>Suppose Albert, a naval captain, has his ship boarded by pirates. By fortunate circumstance, the fierce rocking of the ship has toppled one of the invaders over on the deck of his ship. Advancing towards the sprawling pirate, Albert draws his blade and slashes down upon the unwelcome guest. Attacking a Prone creature confers <strong>2 boons</strong> to Albert's attack roll.</p><p>These two boons upgrade the first die in the <strong>3d8</strong> dice pool twice, from a <strong>d8</strong> to a <strong>d12</strong>, resulting in a dice pool of <strong>1d12 + 1d8 + 1d8</strong>.</p></section><p>Boons or banes resulting from @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.crucibleConditio]{Conditions} like <strong>Prone</strong> will be handled automatically by layers of automation in the Crucible software, but additional boons may always be awarded by the Gamemaster prior to any roll as ways to reward players for creative problem solving or inspirational roleplay.</p><section class=\"gameplay\"><h4>Example: Both Boons and Banes</h4><p>Dariel is an intrepid outdoorswoman with the Journeyman rank in Survival with a Herbalist specialization. She wishes to identify a herb that may be used to treat poison after an arduous day of traveling. Her specialization as a Herbalist gives her <strong>1 Boon</strong> to the roll to identify the correct herb, but her state of exhaustion gives her <strong>2 Banes</strong> to her roll. The boon upgrades the first die in the pool to a <strong>d10</strong>, and the two banes downgrade the third die to a <strong>d4</strong>, resulting in a dice pool of <strong>1d10 + 1d8 + 1d4</strong>.</p></section><p>Mathematically, each Boon increases the expected result of its die by 1 and each Bane decreases the expected result of its die by 1.</p>"

Your character's initiative during combat is determined by your Dexterity and Intellect attributes, any passive Initiative Bonus you may have, any situational bonus which allows you to react faster than usual, and an element of random chance.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Rounds and Turns</h2><p>Each combat encounter is divided into <strong>Rounds</strong> and <strong>Turns</strong>. A <strong>Round</strong> refers to a single set of choices made by the characters in the encounter, where each character gets to act in an order defined by their <strong>Initiative</strong>. Each round loosely represents 10 seconds of real time, where 6 rounds of combat occur each minute of the encounter's duration. A <strong>Turn</strong> represents the actions taken by the one character whose turn it is to act in the initiative order.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Initiative Calculation</h2><p>Your initiative is determined by:</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Initiative</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">3d8[Boons,Banes] + ((Dexterity + Intellect) / 4)</p></section><p>A situational bonus to initiative could result from you getting the drop on an enemy, or benefiting from a magical spell which hastens your reactions, alternatively you could face a situational penalty to initiative if your reactions are dulled or slowed by alchemical or magical effects.</p><p>Each round of combat you have a pool of Action Points which you may elect to spend in various ways. If you are not immobilized or incapacitated, any unspent Action Points at the end of each round are defined as action reserves which each add a <strong>Boon</strong> to your Initiative roll for the following round.</p><blockquote><p>Re-rolling initiative every round introduces greater tactical challenge for players who cannot rely completely upon always acting before or after the same foes each round of combat. Being able to convert unspent action points into an initiative bonus in the subsequent round can also promote creative tactical solutions to a variety of combat challenges.</p></blockquote><h4>Automatic Initiative</h4><p>Since <strong>Initiative</strong> automatically updates every <strong>Round</strong> of combat, players do not roll for Initiative themselves. Instead this process is automated that every character's initiative roll is automatically performed in order to maintain a satisfying pace to combat encounters.</p><h4>Incapacitated Combatants</h4><p>Combatants who are <strong>Incapacitated</strong> or <strong>Dead</strong> are automatically placed at Initiative 0 and their turns come last in each Round.</p><h4>Tiebreaking Procedures</h4><p>Ties in initiative are resolved by applying the following tiebreaking criteria in order:</p><ol><li><p>Combatants with a higher passive <strong>Initiative</strong> bonus.</p></li><li><p>Combatants with more maximum <strong>Action</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adversaries</strong> act before <strong>Heroes</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Any remaining ties are placed in alphabetical order.</p></li></ol><h2 class=\"divider\">Escalation and Morale</h2><p>As the tension of combat escalates - so too do the consequences on <strong>Morale</strong> for combatants. After 6 Rounds of Combat at the start of each subsequent round, the combatant with the highest <strong>Initiative</strong> result gains additional Morale equal to the numbered <strong>Round</strong> of combat. The combatant with the lowest Initiative result (excluding Incapacitated and Dead combatants) loses Morale equal to the numbered Round of combat.</p>"

Attack Rolls apply to weapon attacks, spell casts, healing abilities, and even some skill checks which are performed in combat.</p><p>The player whose character is performing the Attack is always the one to make the roll, while the effectiveness of the defending character or creature is based on their defense scores. The Attack Roll uses the same modified dice pool as a Standard Check, expressed as:</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Attack Roll</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">3d8[+Boons, -Banes] + Ability Modifier + Skill Bonus + Enchantment Bonus</p></section><p>The 3d8 dice pool is modified by <strong>Boons</strong> and <strong>Banes</strong>. The ability modifier for the attack roll is determined by the scaling formula of the weapon type being used. The Skill Bonus for the attack roll is determined by the character's training in that particular weapon type. The Enchantment Bonus for the roll is determined by the magical properties (if any) of the weapon being used.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Determining Attack Outcomes</h2><p>The attack is a hit if the result of the Attack Roll exceeds the Defense score of the target. If the result of the attack roll is less than the Defense score, the attack is ineffective. For attacks which target Physical Defense the nature of the miss (Deflected, Blocked, Dodged, or Parried) is further determined by the component Physical Defense scores of the target creature.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Overflow and Damage</h2><p>The amount by which the Attack Roll exceeded the Defense score is called <strong>Overflow</strong>. This Overflow amount is multiplied by a <strong>Damage Multiplier</strong> which is usually 1, but occasionally higher or lower. Then any additive <strong>Damage Bonus</strong> is applied, and lastly any <strong>Resistance</strong> possessed by the target creature is subtracted from the result.</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Overflow</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">Attack Roll - Defense Score</p></section><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Damage</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">(Overflow × Damage Multiplier) + Damage Bonus - Target Resistance</p></section><p>While Damage Resistance is a powerful way for creatures to reduce incoming damage, such damage cannot be mitigated entirely. Abilities which deal direct (immediate) damage that surpass the target's Defense Score always deal at least 1 point of damage to their target Resource.</p><p>Abilities which deal indirect damage-over-time, however, can have the effects of that indirect damage reduced to zero by Resistance.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Critical Hits and Misses</h2><p>If the Attack Roll exceeds the Defense Score by an amount greater than the attacker's Critical Hit Threshold (6 in most cases) it becomes a <strong>Critical Hit</strong>. Similarly if the Attack Roll is lower than the Defense Score by an amount greater than the attacker's Critical Miss Threshold (6 in most cases) it becomes a <strong>Critical Miss</strong>.</p><p>A Critical Hit does not directly increase the damage of an attack - although because of the way that Overflow contributes to total damage, Critical Hits always deal more damage than normal hits.</p><p>Critical Hits and Critical Misses present opportunities for other things to occur. Many talents allow your character to cause special effects when achieving a Critical Hit, or to react to an enemy if an incoming attack is a Critical Miss.</p><section class=\"gameplay\"><h4>Critical Hit Effects</h4><p>Zenith the Monk has both the <strong>Concussive Blows</strong> and <strong>Battle Focus</strong> talents.

The ease of adjusting the <strong>Level</strong> or <strong>Threat</strong> of an @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.v1dqTT3NI35lFNxM.JournalEntryPage.WH0YSVcYo09aHNZ2]{adversary } makes it easy to adjust an encounter to this point of balance ahead of time. </p><p>Encounters balanced in this way have an approximately 50% chance of going in the party's favor and a 50% chance of going in the enemies' favor. This does not mean that the party \"loses\" or \"dies\" half the time, but rather in 50% of balanced encounters the party will suffer some number of <strong>Wounds</strong>.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Wounds Regulate Luck </h2><p> The accumulation of these <strong>Wounds</strong> is something that the heroes must manage over the course of multiple encounters or days. Since adversaries do not have <strong>Wounds</strong>, only <strong>Health</strong> this is an intentional advantage in favor of Hero characters.</p><p>In any single balanced encounter if the heroes get lucky or play well, they will win without suffering any <strong>Wounds</strong>. If the heroes play poorly or experience bad luck, they will probably still win but suffer <strong>Wounds</strong> in the process. Wounds are a mechanism to regulate swings in luck while also requiring the party to be effective combatants most of the time.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">The Role of the Gamemaster</h2><p>Lastly, the <strong>Gamemaster</strong> plays a pivotal role in ensuring the fun and balance of combat. Enemies in Crucible are generally optimized such that they can be very effective at their main combat style. This is done because we assume that player characters are also designed and progressed with — to at least some extent — combat effectiveness in mind.</p><p>It is not a goal of Crucible to <em>require</em> that every player character be maximally optimized or that every decision in combat be one that optimizes for victory rather than advancing the story being told. It is therefore important that the Gamemaster to calibrate the optimization of their own play to match the party and the needs of the storytelling moment.</p><p>Adversaries in Crucible can and should be fallible in the decisions that they make. Enemies can, and often should, spend their Action and Focus in combat on actions that maintain tension and stakes while prioritizing the needs of the story rather than actions that specifically optimize to defeat the heroes.</p>"

Fortitude is modified by <strong>Strength</strong> and <strong>Wisdom</strong> which represent physical resistance and mental resilience respectively. Fortitude defense is calculated as:</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Fortitude Defense</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">12 + ((Strength + Wisdom) / 2) + Fortitude Bonus</p></section><h4>Willpower</h4><p><strong>Willpower Defense</strong> describes a character's ability to withstand mental or emotional attacks.

As creatures become more severely wounded, they grow more difficult to heal. This provides a measure of attrition which requires adventures to carefully manage their accumulation of <strong>Wounds </strong>over time. Healing threshold is calculated as:</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Healing Threshold</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">12 + (Wounds / 10) - Bonus</p></section><h4>Rallying Threshold</h4><p><strong>Rallying Threshold</strong> describes how difficult it is to restore the Morale of a creature. As creatures become more psychologically damaged they become more difficult to rally. This provides a measure of attrition which requires adventurers to carefully manage their accumulation of <strong>Madness</strong> over time. Rallying threshold is calculated as:</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Rallying Threshold</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">12 + (Madness / 10) - Bonus</p></section><h4>Threshold Bonuses</h4><p>Bonuses to these Restoration Threshold defenses may be obtained through Talents or magical Equipment.

As characters advance in level they attain tiers of power where their physical, mental, and social capabilities are truly legendary. Character advancement in Crucible is level-based. Increases in level grant additional Ability, Skill, and Talent points to spend which increase a character's power and capabilities. The maximum character level in Crucible is anticipated to be <strong>18</strong>.</p><section class=\"foundryvtt\"><p>Character creation is an easy process which begins by creating a <strong>New Actor</strong> of the <strong>Hero</strong> type. Creating a character is a guided process with a unique interface that walks you through the process step-by-step. You may reset the character creation process at any time by clicking the \"restart\" button located at the top right of the character creation screen.</p></section><p></p><h2 class=\"divider\">Starting Level</h2><p>If organizing a gameplay experience that seeks to tell the origin story of heroes, starting your game at Level 1 is the recommended choice. If, however, you want to jump into an adventure with characters who are already established champions, beginning at a higher level may be more suitable.</p><blockquote><p>If starting at a higher level than 1, we recommend each player prepare a set of short anecdotes which explain the skill and talent advancements that their character has unlocked prior to the start of the game. This process helps to solidify their character backstory through past events that explain their heroic capabilities.</p></blockquote><p>Review the pages in this journal entry to understand the steps of character creation and the choices you will make during that process.</p>"

The Threat Categories in the Crucible system are:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Threat Category</th><th>Threat Multiplier</th><th>Action Points</th><th style=\"width:50%\">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Minion</td><td>× 0.5</td><td>2</td><td>Weaker than average foes at a given level, minions are less dangerous and more easily dispatched - but may be numerous in quantity.</td></tr><tr><td><p>Normal</p></td><td>× 1</td><td>3</td><td>The standard level of difficulty and challenge for a certain level.</td></tr><tr><td>Elite</td><td>× 1.5</td><td>4</td><td>Stronger than average foes at a given level, elites are more dangerous and more difficult to dispatch. Elites are more rarely encountered.</td></tr><tr><td>Boss</td><td>× 2</td><td>5</td><td>Especially dangerous enemies which represent the ultimate degree of challenge at a certain level. Most encounters do not contain a boss.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 class=\"divider\">Attribute Scaling</h2><p>Where Protagonists feature an <strong>Ancestry</strong> and <strong>Background</strong>, instead Adversaries use the concepts of @UUID[.qSeJNy28eK9axO7C]{Taxonomy} and @UUID[.O8IesdQo8SQpIKbo]{Archetype}, both of which define how the attributes of the Adversary progress as it increases in Threat Level.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Adversary Talents</h2><p>Adversaries may be assigned additional Talents in addition to those automatically provided by their Archetype.</p><section class=\"construction\"><p>Eventually there may be some rules limiting the number and tier of Talents that an Adversary may have, but for the time being it is acceptable for Adversaries to have any talents that the Gamemaster wishes to give them in addition to the Talents automatically provided by their Archetype.</p></section><h2 class=\"divider\">Defeating Adversaries</h2><p>Adversaries do not have <strong>Wounds</strong> or <strong>Madness</strong> pools like Protagonist characters, instead their ability to withstand harm is determined entirely by <strong>Health</strong> and <strong>Morale</strong>.</p><p>When an Adversary <strong>Health</strong> pool reaches zero it becomes @Condition[dead] or, if preferred by the Gamemaster for narrative reasons, @Condition[incapacitated], and takes no further action during the encounter.</p><p>When Adversary <strong>Morale</strong> reaches zero it becomes @Condition[broken]. A Broken Adversary will attempt to flee the battlefield unless they lack instincts of self-preservation or the possibility of escape seems impossible - in which case they will continue to fight to the death.</p>"
