Duurath will close on enemy combatants using <strong>Shield Charge</strong> and lock them down using <strong>Cadence</strong> to deliver high damage or <strong>Counter Strike</strong> to retaliate when blocking incoming blows.

She will use <strong>Distract</strong> against enemy spellcasters to sap their Focus, and <strong>Combat Medicine</strong> to restore the health of her allies. Belladonna will seek out more vulnerable enemy combatants, closing to melee range using <strong>Tumble </strong>if necessary and <strong>Flurry</strong> to apply rapid damage and poisoned conditions.</p><h4>Eliorwen</h4><p><strong>Eliorwen</strong> is a deadly archer, infusing shots from her Longbow with lightning spells using her <strong>Arcane Archer</strong> talent. Eliorwen will identify a dangerous enemy and target them with <strong>Mark Prey</strong> to reduce their defenses for herself and her allies. She will use <strong>Precision Shot</strong> coupled with reduced cost <strong>Voltaic Arrow</strong> to deliver reliable sustained damage from a distance.</p><h4>Kagura</h4><p><strong>Kagura</strong> is a versatile support character able to heal both mind and body of her allies. She will cast the <strong>Life</strong> rune using either the <strong>Influence</strong>, <strong>Pulse</strong>, or <strong>Ray</strong> gestures to trigger additional healing from her <strong>Mender</strong> talent. Kagura can sustain healing nearly indefinitely through thoughtful use of the <strong>Compose</strong> inflection as well as <strong>Conserve Effort</strong>. Kagura avoids direct confrontation and instead will disengage from combat and seek protection from her allies.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Advancement</h2><p>The fight ends when all four adversaries are defeated.
