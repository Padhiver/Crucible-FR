The system’s dice mechanics allow for crunchy and tactically rich encounters featuring combat, exploration, or social challenges.</p><p>Crucible is both a role-playing game and a software engine. The game system offers a deep level of mechanical sophistication, but its rules are entirely encoded to be applied with consistency and automation. The system is built intentionally to eliminate the cumbersome bookkeeping that is prevalent in high-crunch pen-and-paper systems.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Development Status</h2><p>Crucible is now available for its <strong>Alpha Playtest</strong> which provides the community with a first look at the system, design pillars, and intended direction. The system is moderately functional, but still early in development. All areas of the system are works-in-progress and some areas are not yet developed at all. This playtest offers a chance for us to collect early feedback and share our work with the community. Please approach it with an open mind and an understanding that what you are seeing is still a long way from a finished product.</p><section class=\"construction\"><p>Blocks like this one in the system documentation highlight areas of the system that still require substantial development. These are intended to make you aware of areas that are intentionally unfinished at this time.</p></section><p>Development of Crucible is two-pronged with an equal focus on developing the system mechanics of the roleplaying game and the software implementation of those mechanics simultaneously. As the game mechanics evolve, new developments of the game system will enable those features for use in testing. The playtest process allows us to solicit and benefit from feedback that helps us iterate on the game rules and the user experience in Foundry Virtual Tabletop. We anticipate hosting multiple rounds of feedback, each focusing on a different aspect of the game experience.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Playtest One</h2><p>The first playtest, @UUID[Compendium.crucible.playtest.Adventure.F8AILycmdj2kuOVa]{Playtest 1 - The Ring of Valor}, is focused on @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.gszlBVQ5fGh3y0I6]{Character Creation} and @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.QhZgmBrdLAGwYy5c]{Combat Encounters}. This playtest provides an abbreviated introduction to the Crucible game system, covering character creation, dice mechanics, combat encounters, and level advancement. The playtest begins at level 1 and advances characters through level 6 allowing them to evolve and advance their character between each challenge of the test.</p><section class=\"construction\"><p>Please note that the rules and mechanics featured in this playtest are not final. Most talents, skills, and rules will be further refined during later phases of development.</p></section><h2 class=\"divider\">Ember</h2><p>There is far more Crucible content available as part of our original setting and epic adventure <a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/ember\">Ember</a>, which is now in Kickstarter Beta testing phase. Ember is available for pre-order, and will contain an immense campaign for Crucible spanning several years of gameplay taking your party from character level 1 to 12 (or beyond).</p>"

          "name": "System Cornerstones",
          "text": "<p>Crucible is built with the following cornerstones and design principles in mind.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Consequential Character Progression</h2><p>A primary goal for Crucible is to provide systems for meaningful, exciting, and impactful character progression. Creating and advancing a character in Crucible should be enjoyable and impactful as you gain access to new capabilities that tangibly evolve your playstyle and character persona.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Strategic Grid-Based Combat</h2><p>Game mechanics in Crucible are designed for application to encounter or area maps with a structured grid which defines distances and positions of characters to create tactical choices about movement during combat. Movement actions and costs, engagement, flanking, cover, area-of-effect abilities, and more are all ways to add tactical nuance and dynamism to combat.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Consistently Automated Mechanics</h2><p>A key goal for Crucible is to design and implement mechanics which are seamlessly automated or theoretically capable of seamless automation. We don't want automation that distracts from gameplay with the need for bookkeeping - but we also want the underlying game mechanics which are automated to be understandable to players at the table. We don't want mechanics which are inscrutable simply because we have a layer of automation in front of them. In Crucible you will find game mechanics which are elegantly and intuitively designed, but our approach to full automation of those mechanics means you can stay focused on the fun of roleplaying.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Bring Your Own Story</h2><p>Crucible is optimized and designed with extended-form narrative in mind. While it can be used for one-shot adventures, the system's mechanics are intended to play out over months or years of game sessions.</p><p>Crucible provides relatively little rule-based guidance around narrative, personal character story, or the development of intrapersonal relationships - deliberately leaving these narrative pillars for the Game Master and players to explore using whatever setting or storytelling style they most prefer.</p><p>Crucible intentionally does not define a canonical setting. The system provides Gamemasters with tools to apply the system to a variety of settings. As a general rule of thumb, Crucible will work best in a gritty fantasy setting but it can be adapted for other genres and tones.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Ease of Powerful Use</h2><p>Crucible is designed to be a system which is easy to learn and easy to use. Gamemasters should feel empowered to tell the stories they want to tell, and players to play the characters they want to play. We want game mechanics in Crucible to be crunchy and strategic while being presented to players in a way that is intuitive and fun to engage with.</p>"

          "text": "<p>Crucible uses the standard set of role-playing game dice; relying upon 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20-sided dice for various rolls. These dice are referred to as <strong>d4</strong>, <strong>d6</strong>, <strong>d8</strong>, <strong>d10</strong>, and <strong>d12</strong>, where a number that precedes the die type represents the quantity of that die to roll, for example <strong>4d6</strong> provides instruction to roll four six-sided dice.</p><blockquote><p>Crucible is designed specifically for Foundry Virtual Tabletop, but its dice mechanics are possible to play outside of a digital environment, albeit with a fairly high level of bookkeeping required.</p></blockquote><p>When your character performs heroic actions within the world, whether they be feats of martial prowess or clever social maneuvers, the outcomes of the attempted action are discovered by rolling dice.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Standard Check</h2><p>The standard approach towards determining the outcome of a dice check in Crucible uses a dice pool comprised of three dice, typically 3d8, which are added together. The exact dice used in the pool are modified depending on the <strong>Boons</strong> or <strong>Banes</strong> which apply to the roll. Added to the result of these three dice are Ability, Skill, and Enchantment bonuses which further increase the value of the result. This type of dice roll is referred to as a <strong>Standard Check</strong>.</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Standard Check</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">3d8[Boons,Banes] + Ability Bonus + Skill Bonus + Enchantment Bonus</p></section>"

          "text": "<blockquote><p>A goblin desperately thrusts at an armored human with its damaged, dull blade. An enchanter wishes to haggle with a merchant she has magically charmed. A soldier swings his hammer at the head of a dazed, concussed ogre. When performing a check, a character may find some favorable circumstances shift the odds in their favor. Other disadvantageous circumstances will hinder a character's odds of success.</p></blockquote><p>Circumstances which apply beneficial or detrimental forces upon the likelihood of a check being successful are represented as <strong>Boons</strong> and <strong>Banes</strong>, respectively. The number of boons and banes to be applied to a roll are determined before a roll is made, as they directly affect the composition of the dice pool that is used. A single dice pool roll can have no more than 6 boons and 6 banes affecting it.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Boons</h2><p>Each <strong>Boon</strong> applied to the check increments the denomination of the first die in the pool by +2, to a maximum of <strong>d12</strong>. If a die is already a d12 due to other boons, the increase is applied to the next die in the pool. In practical terms, boons upgrade dice making them bigger and more effective.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Banes</h2><p>Each <strong>Bane</strong> applied to the check decrements the denomination of the last die in the pool by -2, to a minimum of <strong>d4</strong>. If a die is already a d4 due to other banes, the decrease is applied to the next die in the pool. In practical terms, banes downgrade dice making them smaller and less effective.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Mitigating Circumstances</h2><p>Because boons and banes start at opposite ends of the dice pool, they can both affect changes to the same roll. For example, a check made with with 2 Boons and 2 Banes would result in a dice pool of <strong>1d12 + 1d8 + 1d4</strong>. If more than four Boons and more than four Banes are present their effects will begin to cancel each other out.</p><section class=\"gameplay\"><h4>Example: Added Boons</h4><p>Suppose Albert, a naval captain, has his ship boarded by pirates. By fortunate circumstance, the fierce rocking of the ship has toppled one of the invaders over on the deck of his ship. Advancing towards the sprawling pirate, Albert draws his blade and slashes down upon the unwelcome guest. Attacking a Prone creature confers <strong>2 boons</strong> to Albert's attack roll.</p><p>These two boons upgrade the first die in the <strong>3d8</strong> dice pool twice, from a <strong>d8</strong> to a <strong>d12</strong>, resulting in a dice pool of <strong>1d12 + 1d8 + 1d8</strong>.</p></section><p>Boons or banes resulting from @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.crucibleConditio]{Conditions} like <strong>Prone</strong> will be handled automatically by layers of automation in the Crucible software, but additional boons may always be awarded by the Gamemaster prior to any roll as ways to reward players for creative problem solving or inspirational roleplay.</p><section class=\"gameplay\"><h4>Example: Both Boons and Banes</h4><p>Dariel is an intrepid outdoorswoman with the Journeyman rank in Survival with a Herbalist specialization. She wishes to identify a herb that may be used to treat poison after an arduous day of traveling. Her specialization as a Herbalist gives her <strong>1 Boon</strong> to the roll to identify the correct herb, but her state of exhaustion gives her <strong>2 Banes</strong> to her roll. The boon upgrades the first die in the pool to a <strong>d10</strong>, and the two banes downgrade the third die to a <strong>d4</strong>, resulting in a dice pool of <strong>1d10 + 1d8 + 1d4</strong>.</p></section><p>Mathematically, each Boon increases the expected result of its die by 1 and each Bane decreases the expected result of its die by 1.</p>"

Your character's initiative during combat is determined by your Dexterity and Intellect attributes, any passive Initiative Bonus you may have, any situational bonus which allows you to react faster than usual, and an element of random chance.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Rounds and Turns</h2><p>Each combat encounter is divided into <strong>Rounds</strong> and <strong>Turns</strong>. A <strong>Round</strong> refers to a single set of choices made by the characters in the encounter, where each character gets to act in an order defined by their <strong>Initiative</strong>. Each round loosely represents 10 seconds of real time, where 6 rounds of combat occur each minute of the encounter's duration. A <strong>Turn</strong> represents the actions taken by the one character whose turn it is to act in the initiative order.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Initiative Calculation</h2><p>Your initiative is determined by:</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Initiative</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">3d8[Boons,Banes] + ((Dexterity + Intellect) / 4)</p></section><p>A situational bonus to initiative could result from you getting the drop on an enemy, or benefiting from a magical spell which hastens your reactions, alternatively you could face a situational penalty to initiative if your reactions are dulled or slowed by alchemical or magical effects.</p><p>Each round of combat you have a pool of Action Points which you may elect to spend in various ways. If you are not immobilized or incapacitated, any unspent Action Points at the end of each round are defined as action reserves which each add a <strong>Boon</strong> to your Initiative roll for the following round.</p><blockquote><p>Re-rolling initiative every round introduces greater tactical challenge for players who cannot rely completely upon always acting before or after the same foes each round of combat. Being able to convert unspent action points into an initiative bonus in the subsequent round can also promote creative tactical solutions to a variety of combat challenges.</p></blockquote><h4>Automatic Initiative</h4><p>Since <strong>Initiative</strong> automatically updates every <strong>Round</strong> of combat, players do not roll for Initiative themselves. Instead this process is automated that every character's initiative roll is automatically performed in order to maintain a satisfying pace to combat encounters.</p><h4>Incapacitated Combatants</h4><p>Combatants who are <strong>Incapacitated</strong> or <strong>Dead</strong> are automatically placed at Initiative 0 and their turns come last in each Round.</p><h4>Tiebreaking Procedures</h4><p>Ties in initiative are resolved by applying the following tiebreaking criteria in order:</p><ol><li><p>Combatants with a higher passive <strong>Initiative</strong> bonus.</p></li><li><p>Combatants with more maximum <strong>Action</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adversaries</strong> act before <strong>Heroes</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Any remaining ties are placed in alphabetical order.</p></li></ol><h2 class=\"divider\">Escalation and Morale</h2><p>As the tension of combat escalates - so too do the consequences on <strong>Morale</strong> for combatants. After 6 Rounds of Combat at the start of each subsequent round, the combatant with the highest <strong>Initiative</strong> result gains additional Morale equal to the numbered <strong>Round</strong> of combat.

Attack Rolls apply to weapon attacks, spell casts, healing abilities, and even some skill checks which are performed in combat.</p><p>The player whose character is performing the Attack is always the one to make the roll, while the effectiveness of the defending character or creature is based on their defense scores. The Attack Roll uses the same modified dice pool as a Standard Check, expressed as:</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Attack Roll</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">3d8[+Boons, -Banes] + Ability Modifier + Skill Bonus + Enchantment Bonus</p></section><p>The 3d8 dice pool is modified by <strong>Boons</strong> and <strong>Banes</strong>. The ability modifier for the attack roll is determined by the scaling formula of the weapon type being used. The Skill Bonus for the attack roll is determined by the character's training in that particular weapon type. The Enchantment Bonus for the roll is determined by the magical properties (if any) of the weapon being used.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Determining Attack Outcomes</h2><p>The attack is a hit if the result of the Attack Roll exceeds the Defense score of the target. If the result of the attack roll is less than the Defense score, the attack is ineffective.

This Overflow amount is multiplied by a <strong>Damage Multiplier</strong> which is usually 1, but occasionally higher or lower. Then any additive <strong>Damage Bonus</strong> is applied, and lastly any <strong>Resistance</strong> possessed by the target creature is subtracted from the result.</p><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Overflow</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">Attack Roll - Defense Score</p></section><section class=\"formula\"><p class=\"value\">Damage</p><p class=\"equals\">=</p><p class=\"equation\">(Overflow × Damage Multiplier) + Damage Bonus - Target Resistance</p></section><p>While Damage Resistance is a powerful way for creatures to reduce incoming damage, such damage cannot be mitigated entirely. Abilities which deal direct (immediate) damage that surpass the target's Defense Score always deal at least 1 point of damage to their target Resource.</p><p>Abilities which deal indirect damage-over-time, however, can have the effects of that indirect damage reduced to zero by Resistance.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Critical Hits and Misses</h2><p>If the Attack Roll exceeds the Defense Score by an amount greater than the attacker's Critical Hit Threshold (6 in most cases) it becomes a <strong>Critical Hit</strong>. Similarly if the Attack Roll is lower than the Defense Score by an amount greater than the attacker's Critical Miss Threshold (6 in most cases) it becomes a <strong>Critical Miss</strong>.</p><p>A Critical Hit does not directly increase the damage of an attack - although because of the way that Overflow contributes to total damage, Critical Hits always deal more damage than normal hits.</p><p>Critical Hits and Critical Misses present opportunities for other things to occur.

Action Points signify and represent the time and physical exertion required in order to perform an action in the midst of combat.</p><h4>Focus Cost</h4><p>Some actions may incur a cost in <strong>Focus Points</strong>. Focus Points signify and represent the mental energy and concentration needed to perform exceptional feats of heroism, spellcraft, or martial prowess.</p><h4>Action Tags</h4><p>The functionality of Actions relies on a large set of tags which describe how that action behaves. Each tag can change certain aspects of the Action like it's prerequisites, it's target, the type of damage it deals, what type of dice roll is applied, whether Boons or Banes are added to the roll, and more. A table of Action Tags is listed at the bottom of this page.</p><h4>Target Type</h4><p>Each action defines a specific target type which describes the affected creatures or area-of-effect of the action. A list of possible target types is provided in the following section.</p><h4>Target Scope</h4><p>In addition to the range and area of effect of the Action described by the target type, each Action defines a target scope which defines which creature dispositions it can affect. Action scopes include \"all creatures\", \"allies only\", \"enemies only\", \"self only\".</p><h4>Activation Condition</h4><p>Certain actions may require a specific triggering condition to be met in order for the action to be eligible for use. If present, this prerequisite condition will be listed on the action, for example, the <strong>Defensive Roll</strong> action has an activation condition <em>You Dodge an incoming melee Strike</em>.</p><h4>Applied Effects</h4><p>Certain Actions may apply Active Effects to creatures they affect. Any effects applied by the Action will be listed on its card with a stated duration in combat Turns or Rounds. Some effects last until otherwise removed, having unlimited duration.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Target Types</h2><h4>Blast</h4><p>This action affects creatures within a circular area of effect centered on a grid space chosen by the character performing the action. The Blast action also specifies a <strong>Size</strong> which describes the radius of effect and a <strong>Distance</strong> which describes the maximum range between the originating character and the chosen center-point of the blast.</p><h4>Cone</h4><p>This action affects creatures within a narrow cone of effect. The Cone originates at the center of the grid space of the character performing the action. The Cone has an angle of 60 degrees and a specified <strong>Distance</strong> which describes the range of the ability in grid spaces. Cone templates may be placed at 45 degree increments only.</p><h4>Fan</h4><p>This action affects creatures with a broad cone of effect. The Fan originates at the center of the grid space of the character performing the action. The Fan has an angle of 120 degrees and a specified <strong>Distance</strong> which describes the range of the ability in grid spaces. Fan templates may be placed at 45 degree increments only.</p><h4>None</h4><p>This action has no specific target. It may cause certain effects to occur but those effects are not specific to any particular creature. This target type is not typically used.</p><h4>Pulse</h4><p>This action affects creatures in a circular area of effect centered on the character performing the action. The Pulse has a specified <strong>Distance</strong> which describes the radius of the ability in grid spaces.</p><h4>Ray</h4><p>This action affects creatures in a straight line originating from the character performing the action. The Ray has a specified <strong>Distance</strong> which describes the length of its effect in grid spaces.</p><h4>Self</h4><p>This action only involves or affects the character or creature which performs it. Self-target abilities affect no other creatures and have no range requirement.</p><h4>Single</h4><p>This action targets some number of individual creatures other than the creature which performs it. Single target actions also specify a <strong>Number</strong> which describes the number of creatures targeted and a <strong>Distance</strong> which describes the range of the ability in grid spaces.</p><h4>Wall</h4><p>This action targets creatures in a straight line perpendicular to the character performing the action. Actions of the Wall type also specify a <strong>Size</strong> which describes the breadth of the wall and a <strong>Distance</strong> which describes the maximum range at which the center of the wall may be placed.</p><h2 class=\"divider\">Action Tags</h2><table><thead><tr><th style=\"width:30%\">Tag</th><th>Rules Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Dual Wield</p></td><td><p>Requires one-handed or unarmed weapons equipped in both hands.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>One Handed</p></td><td><p>Requires use of a one-handed weapon.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Finesse</p></td><td><p>Requires use of a melee weapon that scales using Dexterity.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Heavy</p></td><td><p>Requires use of a melee weapon that scales using Strength.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Melee</p></td><td><p>Requires use of a melee weapon.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ranged</p></td><td><p>Requires use of a ranged weapon.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Shield</p></td><td><p>Requires a shield equipped.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Unarmed</p></td><td><p>Requires both hands to be empty.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Unarmored</p></td><td><p>Requires no armor to be equipped.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Freehand</p></td><td><p>Requires at least one hand to be empty.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Movement</p></td><td><p>Involves movement and benefits from reduced movement cost once per turn.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Reaction</p></td><td><p>Can only be performed on some other creature's turn.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Spell</p></td><td><p>Involves casting a spell.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mainhand</p></td><td><p>Involves performing a weapon attack with the mainhand-equipped weapon.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Twohand</p></td><td><p>Involves performing a weapon attack with a two-handed equipped weapon.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Offhand</p></td><td><p>Involves performing a weapon attack with the offhand-equipped weapon.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Reload</p></td><td><p>Reloads a ranged weapon that requires reloading.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Deadly</p></td><td><p>Gains a +1 damage overflow multiplier.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Difficult</p></td><td><p>Incurs +1 Bane.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Empowered</p></td><td><p>Increases base damage by +6.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Exposing</p></td><td><p>Adds +2 Boons.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Harmless</p></td><td><p>Always deals zero damage.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Weakened</p></td><td><p>Reduces base damage by -6.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Fortitude</p></td><td><p>Targets Fortitude defense.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Reflex</p></td><td><p>Targets Reflex defense.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Willpower</p></td><td><p>Targets Willpower defense.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Healing</p></td><td><p>Targets Wounds Threshold defense and restores damage as healing to Health.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Rallying</p></td><td><p>Targets Madness Threshold defense and restores damage as healing to Morale.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>&lt;Damage Type&gt;</p></td><td><p>Deals damage as &lt;Damage Type&gt;.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>&lt;Resource&gt;</p></td><td><p>Applies damage or healing to &lt;Resource&gt;.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>&lt;Skill&gt;</p></td><td><p>Performs a skill attack using &lt;Skill&gt;.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>"

His ship is about to be imperilled by a storm, and his crew is looking to him to safely navigate out of the harbor. As a Master Cartographer, Albert taps into his extremely strong knowledge of long-distance travel. This will be a Challenging (DC 25) roll; Albert rolls his Skill check. Unluckily, Albert's dice total turn up <strong>6</strong>, <strong>4</strong>, and <strong>7</strong>— a total of <strong>17</strong> and a far cry from the needed 25. However, Albert's ability score for Strength is quite high at <strong>8</strong>, and his Dexterity is <strong>6, </strong>so the average of the two abilities adds an Ability bonus of <strong>7</strong>. Albert also happens to have a magical set of nautical charts which grant a +2 enchantment bonus, pushing the result of the roll to <strong>26</strong>.</p></section><h2 class=\"divider\">Passive Skill Checks</h2><p>Crucible allows any skill check to be considered passive at the discretion of the gamemaster. In a case where a character's trained skill rank is sufficient to exceed the DC of a roll by adding 12 to it, the check is considered successful without a need to roll.</p><p></p><h2 class=\"divider\">Group Skill Checks</h2><section class=\"foundryvtt\"><p>Crucible's handling of Group Skill Checks is a work in progress at this time, please look forward to a future update that adds this functionality.</p></section><p></p>"

The implementation of the Spellcraft system in Playtest One should provide insight into its mechanics and planned functionality.</p></section><h2 class=\"divider\">Masterful Composition</h2><p>Spellcraft allows characters to manifest magic by composing a spell using a @UUID[.p3hKRiZN3x0DEtyG]{Rune}, @UUID[.lhrYInsQ2f0YfhTu]{Gesture}, and optionally an @UUID[.ELOcfx6LPZMh74y8]{Inflection}.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Runes</strong> represent the base magical essence (such as Spirit or Flame), metaphysical concepts that combine to form the laws of reality.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gestures</strong> represent the forming of the rune into a spell, using physical motion as a somatic component which shape (such as Create or Arrow) a Rune's power, causing it to act in a specific way.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inflections</strong> represent a further change or modification (such as Quicken or Pull), and use vocalization to alter how a spell is formed.</p></li></ul><p>As your character learns Talents which provide Spellcraft components, these components will appear on the Grimoire tab of your character sheet and become usable through the <strong>Cast a Spell</strong> action. The process of learning components and discovering new spell combinations is intended to provide a rewarding experience of magical experimentation and narrative development for characters which invest into Spellcraft.</p><p>It is useful to think of the rules and structure of the Spellcraft system linguistically. If you think of a spell as a sentence, each spell must have a Rune (noun) and a Gesture (verb), and may optionally include an Inflection (adjective/adverb) that modifies either.</p><p>Spells which attack an opponent follow the rules of @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.QhZgmBrdLAGwYy5c.JournalEntryPage.lZfPVvBSsCEqlte4]{Attack Rolls}, with changes to the Ability Bonus and Base Damage of the attack depending on the combination of Rune and Gesture used.</p><section class=\"gameplay\"><h4>Example: Zarajah the Pyromancer</h4><p>Zarajah is an ambitious Level 6 sorcerer who strives to master the arts of elemental magic. Zarajah knows the runes for <strong>Flame</strong>, <strong>Kinesis</strong>, and <strong>Lightning</strong> as well as gestures for <strong>Touch</strong> (automatically learned), <strong>Influence</strong>, and <strong>Arrow</strong>. Additionally, Zarajah has also learned the <strong>Quicken</strong> inflection. Using these components, Zarajah has access to 18 different combinations which form Spells.</p><p>Zarajah's favorite spell is <strong>Quickened Arrow of Flame</strong> which allows her to hurl a projectile of arcane fire at a single target up to 10 spaces distant at the cost of <strong>1 Action</strong> and <strong>2 Focus</strong> points. The Flame rune targets <strong>Reflex</strong> defense and deals <strong>Fire Damage</strong> to <strong>Health</strong>. Arrow and Flame both scale using <strong>Intellect</strong>, so the effectiveness of this spell scales using only Intellect as a single ability score.</p><p>When Zarajah casts a <strong>Quickened Arrow of Flame</strong> towards a swooping Manticore, she rolls a <strong>28</strong> on her spell attack roll, beating the Manticore's Reflex defense of <strong>21</strong>. This <strong>7 Overflow Damage</strong> is increased by the <strong>10 Base Damage</strong> of the Arrow gesture, resulting in a total of <strong>17 Fire Damage</strong> dealt to the foe.</p><p>Since this attack is also a Critical Hit, the Manticore bursts into flame due to Zarajah's <strong>Pyromancer</strong> talent which inflicts the <strong>Burning</strong> condition causing additional damage-over-time.</p></section><h2>The Cost of Magic</h2><p>Every magic spell has a cost- whether used within a combat situation or for out-of-combat benefits.
